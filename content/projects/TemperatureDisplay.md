The idea behind this project was to have a small display that shows the temperature and humidity of the room that is low power and can be mounted on a wall.

It uses an ATTINY85 to read the temperature and humidity from a DHT22 or a DS18B20 sensor, and then displays the information on a SSD1306 OLED display.
